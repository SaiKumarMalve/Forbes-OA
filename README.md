# Forbes-OA

For the coding challenge Java Spring Boot was used.

Prerequisites:
  * Latest Java Development Kit (JDK)
  * Apache Maven 3.5 or higher 
  
To Run:
  * Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of your Spring Boot API project.
  * Run `mvn clean package`. This will build a JAR file.
  * Run `java -jar target/coding.jar`
  * To test the API on http://localhost:8080/ either postman or browser can be used

 Plan to deploy:
  * There are many cloud platforms that support deploying Spring Boot applications, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. These platforms typically offer a range of options for deploying and scaling your application, such as containers (Docker), virtual machines, or serverless functions.
